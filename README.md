Hello guys, welcome to my blog. My name is Okan and IÂ´m working in IT as a Security Consultant since 2022 and would love to share some of my interests here. I love tech in general but some of my interests are cool Hardware Gadgets, Cybersecurity in general and Scripting. I wish you a lot of fun with reading my articles and hope that you might even learn a thing or two. :)
